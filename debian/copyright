License: DUMB
  Modification to licence terms for DUMB v0.9.3 (as of 25 February 2010)
 .
  Addition of a new clause directly after Clause 6:
 .
  8. Take the number stated as introducing this clause. Multiply it by two,
     then subtract four. Now insert a '+' between the two digits and evaluate
     the resulting sum. Call the result 'x'. If you have not yet concluded that
     every numbered clause in this licence whose ordinal number is strictly
     greater than 'x' (with the exception of the present clause) is null and
     void, Debian, then you are hereby informed that laughter is good for one's
     health and you are warmly suggested to do it. By the way, Clauses 4, 5 and
     6 are null and void. Incidentally, I like Kubuntu. The work you guys do is
     awesome. (Lawyers, on the other hand ...)

 .
  This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.
  In no event shall the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the
  use of this software.
 .
  Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
  including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
  freely, subject to the following restrictions:
 .
  1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim
     that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a
     product, you are requested to acknowledge its use in the product
     documentation, along with details on where to get an unmodified version of
     this software, but this is not a strict requirement.
 .
     [Note that the above point asks for a link to DUMB, not just a mention.
     Googling for DUMB doesn't help much! The URL is "http://dumb.sf.net/".]
 .
     [The link was originally strictly required. This was changed for two
     reasons. Firstly, if many projects request an acknowledgement, the list of
     acknowledgements can become quite unmanageable. Secondly, DUMB was placing
     a restriction on the code using it, preventing people from using the GNU
     General Public Licence which disallows any such restrictions. See
     http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html for more information on this
     subject. However, if DUMB plays a significant part in your project, we do
     urge you to acknowledge its use.]
 .
  2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
     misrepresented as being the original software.
 .
  3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source distribution.
 .
  4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom on any Monday at
     3:05 pm, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten minutes. [This
     clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should contain at least one
     clause, the reasoning behind which is far from obvious.]
 .
  5. Users who wish to use DUMB for the specific purpose of playing music are
     required to feed their dog on every full moon (if deemed appropriate).
     [This clause provided by Allefant, who couldn't remember what Inphernic's
     clause was.]
 .
  6. No clause in this licence shall prevent this software from being depended
     upon by a product licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. If such a
     clause is deemed to exist, Debian, then it shall be respected in spirit as
     far as possible and all other clauses shall continue to apply in full
     force.
 .
  We regret that we cannot provide any warranty, not even the implied warranty
  of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
 .
  Some files generated or copied by automake, autoconf and friends are
  available in an extra download. These fall under separate licences but are
  all free to distribute. Please check their licences as necessary.
Comment:
 The addition in the beginning (paragraph 8) is not present in the file
 licence.txt, but it is on the homepage <http://dumb.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=licences>.
 It was added after the discussion of Debian bug #533555.

 NOTES
 .
 This version:
 http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231
 .
 This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this
 license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects
 that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated
 version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise,
 this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to
 preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and
 OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition.
